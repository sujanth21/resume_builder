      question: "Why should I use a resume builder?",
      answer:
        "Using a resume builder makes the process of creating a resume significantly faster and easier. Ever tried building your resume with Word? The whole process is a huge pain – you make a TINY change to your resume, and the entire resume layout gets completely messed up. With a resume builder, you don’t have to worry about the nitty gritty of resume creation, like font selection, layout, formatting, etc. All you have to do is pick a resume template, fill it in, and then you’re ready to start applying for jobs!",
